  <h1>Reasons I Love You <span class="heart">‚ù§</span></h1>

  <p>From awkward high school dances to now, 15 years later... I still can't believe I get to call you mine.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It's so annoying how you're always one step ahead of me. It's like you can read my mind! (But secretly, I love it). <span class="butterfly">ü¶ã</span></li>
    <li>I absolutely hate how creative you are. You make me feel so unoriginal! (Just kidding, I'm constantly in awe of your ideas). <span class="butterfly">ü¶ã</span></li>
    <li>You're way too energetic. Sometimes I just want to relax, but you always drag me into some fun adventure. (And I wouldn't have it any other way). <span class="heart">‚ù§</span></li>
    <li>It's frustrating how strong and resilient you are. You make me feel like I can't complain about anything! (But I admire you so much for it). <span class="heart">‚ù§</span></li>
    <li>You're ridiculously beautiful, inside and out. It's almost unfair! (But seriously, you're radiant). <span class="butterfly">ü¶ã</span></li>
    <li>You're so captivating it's almost distracting. When we're out, I can't focus on anything else! (But I love that feeling). <span class="heart">‚ù§</span></li>
  </ul>

<div class="poem">
    <p>In shadows deep, where secrets reside,<br>
A flame flickered, a love denied.<br>
Two souls entwined, a destined meet,<br>
Yet paths diverged, bittersweet.</p>

<p>Fifteen years passed, like distant dreams,<br>
A chance encounter, it brightly gleams.<br>
Twin flames rekindled, a burning fire,<br>
Forged in the past, reaching ever higher.</p>

<p>Though trust was broken, wounds did bleed,<br>
A second chance, a planted seed.<br>
For love's true course, it finds its way,<br>
Through trials faced, to a brighter day.</p>
